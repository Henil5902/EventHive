         <p>  A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing as well.
Some parties are held in honor of a specific person, day, or event, such as a birthday party, a Super Bowl party, or a St. Patrick’s Day party.
Parties of this kind are often called <b> "celebrations"</b>. A party is not necessarily a private occasion.
Public parties are sometimes held in restaurants, pubs, or bars, and people attending such parties may be charged an admission fee by the host.</p>

                      <p> surprise party is a party that is not made known beforehand to the person in whose honor it is being held.
                        Birthday surprise parties are the most common kind of surprise party. At most such parties, the guests will arrive an hour or so before the honored person arrives. Often, a friend in on the surprise will lead the honored person to the location of the party without letting on anything.
                        The guests might even conceal themselves from view, and when the honored person enters the room, they leap from hiding and all shout, "Surprise!" For some surprise birthday parties, it is considered to be a good tactic to shock the honored person.
                        Streamers, silly string, and balloons may be used for this purpose. Evidence of a party, such as decorations and balloons, are not made visible from the exterior of the home, so that the honored person will suspect nothing.</p>
